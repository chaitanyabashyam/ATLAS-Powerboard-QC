# Data Analysis on quality control test results (from the Inner Tracker production database) of the ATLAS Inner Tracker Strip Detector Powerboard. This script takes a single test variable, such as DC/DC Output Voltage, and creates a histogram of that value across all production Powerboards registered in the ITk database. In order to use, you must have access to the database through two access codes. The script will prompt you to enter these.
